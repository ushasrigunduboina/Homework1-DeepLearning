# Deep-learning-Hm1
This Repository is done for home work Regarding deep learning Assignment.
All the files in the repository are .ipynb files that contain python code snippets and results of executing the code in a sequential manner.
These files contains code related which I had worked on deep learning.
#all these code files can be run on jupiternotebook and also Anaconda must be installed before using jupiternotebook.
 #Then after completing installation we need to install pytorch in Anacond prompt,
 For instalation we need to run the following command in prompt
  [conda install pytorch torchivsion -c pytorch]
 after completing installation we need to open the jupiternotebook and import the files to run
